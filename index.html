                <p id="headline-subheading">Posted on <b>28 April, 2022</b> // Catergory: <b>Sports</b></p>
                <p id="headline-text" >The Delhi Capitals (DC) were back to winning ways in the TATA 
                    Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 after registering a victory against Kolkata 
                    Knight Riders (KKR) by 4 wickets on Thursday at the Wankhede Stadium in 
                    Mumbai. Kuldeep Yadav was the pick of the bowlers as he continued his 
                    impressive run with the ball and starred with a four-wicket haul, leading 
                    DC to a crucial victory. Chasing 147, DC lost Prithvi Shaw’s wicket on 
                    the first ball of the innings after Umesh Yadav took a wonderful catch off 
                    his own bowling. 
                    <span id="hidden-details-4"> <br>
                    Harshit Rana claimed his maiden IPL wicket to dismiss Mitchell 
                    Marsh. David Warner was on the move with five fours and was joined by Lalit Yadav 
                    as DC were 47/2 at the end of the powerplay. The duo stitched a fifty partnership 
                    for the third wicket. Yadav sliced a six followed by a four as DC were 80-2 after 
                    9 overs. Umesh Yadav got KKR back in the game with the wicket of Warner, who was 
                    caught in the deep for 42. KKR scalped two wickets in no time to dismiss Lalit Yadav 
                    and DC skipper Rishabh Pant. While Lalit Yadav was trapped LBW by Narine, Pant was 
                    caught behind off Yadav’s bowling. Axar Patel hit 2 fours and a six before the 
                    left-handed batter was run-out for 24 as DC required 34 off the final five overs. 
                    14 runs were conceded in the 17th over after Rovman Powell whacked a four and six, 
                    bringing DC closer to the target.
